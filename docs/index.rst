Scrybe Documentation
====================

Welcome to the documentation of *Scrybe*.

Scrybe is the newest child in the phpDocumentor series. Contrary to phpDocumentor
it allows you to create user manuals, reference documentation, books, leaflets
and anything in between.

Scrybe aims to support multiple input formats (only RestructuredText at the
moment), combining multiple document sources into one and much much more.
