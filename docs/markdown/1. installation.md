Installation
============

You can install the component in many different ways:

* Download the phar file (<http://www.phpdoc.org/scrybe.phar>) and run it.
* Use the official Git repository (<https://github.com/phpDocumentor/Scrybe>);

> phpDocumentor Scrybe supports the creation of PDFs using LaTeX.
> This requires that several of the LaTeX libraries are installed on your
> system. Unfortunately we are not proficient enough with Latex to identify
> which these are.
> If you know; please contribute that knowledge to this document.
