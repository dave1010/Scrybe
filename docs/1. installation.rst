PDF Support
-----------

phpDocumentor Scrybe supports the creation of PDFs using LaTeX.
This may or may not work depending on the LaTeX libraries installed on your
system.

The following issues and solutions are know to us:

Q: I get the following error: ``LaTeX Error: File 'ucs.sty' not found.``

A: Not all Linux distributions install Unicode support for LaTeX by default.
Debian is an example of this as you need to install the `texlive-latex-extra`
aptitude package.
Please consult the package manager of your distribution of choice to determine
which contains the file `ucs.sty`.
