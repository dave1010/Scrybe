    <p>Scrybe is a toolkit that can be used to generate any type of hand-written document, booklet or even complete books.</p>
    <p>Scrybe is inspired by Sphinx but aims to help authors by allowing a variety of input formats; such as Markdown, Restructured Text and more are coming in the future.</p>
